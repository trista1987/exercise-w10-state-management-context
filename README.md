# React State Management Theme Switcher with useContext Exercise

For this weeks practice you will Create a simple theme switcher where dark/light mode are managed using React's useContext.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server:

Once forked and cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### Looking for some hints?
1. **Theme Management with `useContext`**
    - The `useContext` hook in React allows you to access values from a context without prop-drilling. For this exercise, you're using it to manage a simple theme switcher (light/dark mode).
    - Define a context using `createContext()`. Remember to export both the context and a custom hook (e.g., `useTheme`) to make it easier to access the theme in your components. Follow the naming conventions when you create folders and files. Have a look at the [boilerplate](https://github.com/Technigo/react-vite-use-context-boiler-plate) if you need guidance.

3.  **Integrating Components**
    - In your main `App.jsx`, integrate both the task manager and theme toggler. 
    - Ensure that the `ThemeProvider` wraps your entire application so that the theme context is accessible everywhere.

4.  **Testing**
    - Before pushing to GitHub, test your application and make sure it toggles the theme. Ensure everything works seamlessly.

6.  **Committing and Pushing**
    - Use `git add .` to stage your changes, followed by `git commit -m "Your commit message here"` to commit them.
    - Push your changes to the GitHub repository using `git push origin main`.
